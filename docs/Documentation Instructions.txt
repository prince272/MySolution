C# Documentation Writing Style – Classes and Properties
Class Documentation Style

Start with a single sentence describing the class’s purpose.

Example: “Represents a customer in the system with personal and contact information.”

Use present tense and active voice.

Prefer: “Calculates the total price of an order”

Avoid: “This class was used to calculate…”

Be concise and precise.

Keep summaries to one or two sentences.

Avoid repeating the class name unnecessarily.

Instead of: “The Customer class stores customer data.”

Prefer: “Stores customer data including name and email.”

Focus on purpose and responsibility, not implementation.

Good: “Manages user authentication and session information.”

Avoid: “Contains a dictionary and a login method.”

Add optional context or usage notes only if necessary.

Example: “Used by the registration module to validate user input.”

Use nouns that clearly define what the class represents.

Prefer: “Order, Customer, Invoice”

Avoid vague terms like “Manager, Data, Handler” unless unavoidable.

Avoid subjective or evaluative language.

Don’t say: “Efficient class for storing customers”

Stick to factual description.

Property Documentation Style

Start with a phrase like “Gets or sets…” for standard properties.

Example: “Gets or sets the customer’s email address.”

Use present tense, descriptive nouns, and concise wording.

Prefer: “Indicates whether the order has been shipped.”

Avoid: “This property tells you if the order has been shipped.”

Include context, format, or constraints only if necessary.

Example: “A string up to 50 characters.”

Example: “The date the customer registered.”

Avoid repeating the property name unnecessarily.

Instead of: “The FirstName property stores the first name of the customer”

Prefer: “The customer’s first name.”

For booleans, start with “Indicates whether…” or “Determines if…”

Example: “Indicates whether the account is active.”

For collections, describe the contents rather than the type.

Example: “A list of orders associated with the customer.”

Avoid: “A List<Order> property.”

Be consistent in terminology and phrasing across all properties.

If you say “Gets or sets” for one property, do it for all similar ones.

Avoid implementation details.

Don’t describe how the property works internally. Focus on what it represents.
