1. Form Classes (Request / Payload) Documentation Style

Purpose: Describe what clients must submit when making a request.

Key Features:

Class summary: Short description of the form’s purpose.

Example: Form for user authentication with username and password.

Property summaries:

Describe what clients must provide and why.

Include constraints (length, pattern, required/optional).

Use simple, direct language, in present tense.

Avoid references to storage, getters/setters, or system behavior.

Boolean properties:

Use phrasing like Indicates whether… or Determines if….

Collections:

Describe what’s inside, not the type.

Example: List of selected product IDs. (not IEnumerable<int> of product identifiers)

Tone & style:

Concise, present tense, and focused on input requirements, not implementation.

2. Model Classes (Response) Documentation Style

Purpose: Describe what clients receive after an operation.

Key Features:

Class summary: Explain what the model represents.

Example: User profile details returned after authentication or profile retrieval.

Property summaries:

Describe what the property contains, including format if relevant.

Include constraints only if meaningful to clients (e.g., date format, status codes).

Do not start with "The," "Gets or sets," or repeat the class name.

Use concise, present tense phrasing.

Boolean properties:

Same as forms: Indicates whether… or Determines if….

Collections:

Describe contents, not type.

Example: Orders associated with the customer.

Tone & style:

Focus on what is returned, not system logic.

Present tense, active voice, consistent terminology.

3. Shared Rules Across Forms and Models

Present tense & active voice:

Avoid past/future tense or passive constructions.

Conciseness:

Skip redundant class/property names in the summary.

No implementation details:

Don’t explain how the system stores, calculates, or manages the data.

Consistency:

Maintain the same phrasing style for all classes and properties.

Boolean properties always use Indicates whether… style.

Collections describe contents, not type.

Key Takeaways:

Forms → “What clients must send” → constraints + purpose.

Models → “What clients receive” → content + format.

Property summaries → concise, present tense, consistent.

Boolean & collections → descriptive phrasing.

Class summaries → single sentence describing purpose.
